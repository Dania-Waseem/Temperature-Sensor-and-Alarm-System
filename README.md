**Temperature Monitoring and Alarm System**
<br/>
Create a circuit to monitor temperature using a temperature sensor (e.g., LM35) and display the
current reading on a seven-segment display. Set adjustable thresholds: a green LED lights up
within a safe range, a yellow LED warns of near-threshold temperatures, and a red LED with a
buzzer activates if the temperature exceeds the safe limit.
